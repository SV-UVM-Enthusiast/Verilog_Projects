Verilog Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing a collection of Verilog projects. Each project is a testament to my skills and understanding of digital design. Feel free to explore the details of each project and use them as a learning resource or as a starting point for your own designs.

Projects Included:
**1. Asynchronous FIFO**
Dive into Asynchronous FIFO with two styles – one using GRAY code and another using normal binary. These designs optimize data buffering for reliable communication across different clock domains.

**2. Synchronous FIFO**
Experience seamless data synchronization with the Synchronous FIFO project, ensuring high-performance data transfer in synchronous applications.

**3. SPI Controller**
Master the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) with this versatile controller. Effortlessly implement SPI communication in your designs.

**4. Memory**
Unlock scalable data storage capabilities with the Memory project. Tailor this flexible memory module to suit the needs of your Verilog designs.

**5. FSM Pattern Detector**
Explore various FSM implementations, including dynamic pattern detectors, Mealy machines, Moore machines, and Moore machines with one-hot encoding. Detect patterns with overlapping and non-overlapping features.

**6. D Flip-Flop**
Delve into sequential logic with Asynchronous D Flip-Flop and Synchronous D Flip-Flop designs. Choose the style that suits your digital circuits.

**7. Counter**
Efficiently count events with four counter types: Up counter, down counter, up-down counter, and gray counter. Tailor these counters to your specific application needs.

**Running the Codes**
To run these projects, you'll need ModelSim or EDA Playground. Convenient run.do files are included—just copy the code and start exploring.
Feel free to clone, modify, and integrate these projects into your work. If you find these projects helpful, consider giving a star to the repository. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Happy coding!
